 Hi, I’m @PetErSitcHon
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming that is why l tried my best to learn something new about this field and also I love  designing webpage or anything but at this moment I'm just still a beginner and I need to learn alot more to make myself proud 🥲.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web developing like Html, Css, JavaScript and more that needed to build a web.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on grinding a knowledge on this field I want someone to talk about coding and also to guide or help me and vise versa.
- 📫 And if you are interested to collaborate with me you can reach me in my Facebook account: Peter U. Sitchon or you can also make email to me "petersitchon31@gmail.com".
